# Stellar-tipchain-backend

A REST API backend for a Stellar-based tip chain. Creators register with a username and Stellar wallet address, and supporters send tips by submitting verified on-chain Stellar transactions.

## Overview

Stellar-tipchain-backend is a Rust web service built with [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) and [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) that enables a creator tipping system on top of the [Stellar](https://stellar.org) blockchain. It acts as a trusted intermediary that:

1. Stores creator profiles (username + Stellar wallet address) in PostgreSQL.
2. Accepts tip submissions from supporters.
3. Verifies each tip transaction directly on the Stellar network via the [Horizon API](https://developers.stellar.org/api) before persisting it.

No funds are held by this backend — all money movement happens on-chain. The backend only records and verifies.

---

## How It Works

### Creator Registration

A creator calls `POST /creators` with their username and Stellar wallet address. The backend stores this in the `creators` table. The wallet address is the destination where supporters will send XLM (or other Stellar assets) on-chain.

### Sending a Tip (Supporter Flow)

1. The supporter opens their Stellar wallet and sends a payment to the creator's wallet address on the Stellar network.
2. After the transaction is confirmed on-chain, the supporter submits the transaction hash to `POST /tips` along with the creator's username and the tip amount.
3. The backend calls the Stellar Horizon API to look up the transaction by hash and confirms:
   - The transaction exists on the network.
   - The transaction has `"successful": true`.
4. If verification passes, the tip is saved to the `tips` table and a `201 Created` response is returned.
5. If the transaction cannot be found or was not successful, a `422 Unprocessable Entity` is returned.
6. If the Horizon API is unreachable, a `502 Bad Gateway` is returned.

### Querying Tips

Anyone can call `GET /creators/:username/tips` to retrieve the full tip history for a creator.

### On-Chain Verification Flow

```
Supporter wallet ──sends XLM──► Creator wallet (Stellar network)
                                        │
                                  tx_hash returned
                                        │
Supporter ──POST /tips──► Backend ──GET /transactions/:hash──► Horizon API
                                        │
                                  verified ✓
                                        │
                              saved to PostgreSQL
```

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (edition 2021)
- PostgreSQL 12 or later
- A Stellar account and access to the Stellar Horizon API (testnet or mainnet)

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/stellar-tipchain-backend.git
cd stellar-tipchain-backend

# Copy the example environment file and fill in your values
cp .env.example .env

# Build the project
cargo build
```

---

## Configuration

All configuration is provided through environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set each value:

| Variable          | Required | Default                              | Description                                      |
|-------------------|----------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `DATABASE_URL`    | Yes      | —                                    | PostgreSQL connection string, e.g. `postgres://user:password@localhost/tipchain` |
| `STELLAR_NETWORK` | No       | `testnet`                            | Stellar network to use: `testnet` or `mainnet`   |
| `STELLAR_RPC_URL` | No       | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org`| Soroban RPC endpoint                             |
| `PORT`            | No       | `8000`                               | Port the HTTP server listens on                  |

Logging verbosity is controlled by the `RUST_LOG` environment variable (defaults to `stellar_tipchain_backend=debug,tower_http=debug`).

---

## Running the Server

```bash
# Development
cargo run

# Production (optimised binary)
cargo build --release
./target/release/stellar-tipchain-backend
```

The server applies any pending database migrations automatically on startup, then begins listening on `0.0.0.0:<PORT>`.

## Database Migrations

Migrations live in the `migrations/` directory and run automatically at startup via SQLx.

To manage migrations manually, install the SQLx CLI:

```bash
cargo install sqlx-cli

# Create a new migration
sqlx migrate add -r <migration_name>

# Run pending migrations
sqlx migrate run

# Revert the last migration
sqlx migrate revert
```

## Current Status

This project is currently **~30% complete**. The following is in place:

- [x] Cargo.toml with all dependencies
- [x] Database migrations (creators + tips tables)
- [x] Data models (`Creator`, `Tip`, request DTOs)
- [x] `AppState` with PostgreSQL pool
- [x] `main.rs` connects to DB and runs migrations

Still to be implemented:

- [ ] `StellarService` — Horizon API transaction verification
- [ ] `TipService` — tip business logic
- [ ] Controllers — request handlers
- [ ] Routes — Axum router wiring
- [ ] Full server bootstrap (CORS, `axum::serve`)
